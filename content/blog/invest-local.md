# Invest Local or Global?

Are you one of those looking for the safe and best investing option in this pandemic hit market? If yes, then you landed in the right spot! Read on to know more!

Investing has been a common trend passing through generations in the world. Warren Buffet once said, “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die”. Thus, having a passive income is every individual’s long-term goal today.

When we speak of long-term goals, sectors like Real estate and manufacturing have an upper hand. For long term investors, the main goal is to make great wealth to secure an early retirement plan, as well as gain financial freedom in the long run. In countries like India, Real estate investment has been a regular practice or legacy passing through generations as they believe that investment in tangible assets such as a property will never go out of style! But do you know what is the backdrop behind this? Exposure and scope of global markets!

Yes! Global markets are also one of the things to consider when investment is key aspects of planning a future today. The reason being is simple! Unlike the local markets where competitors and demand of properties can easily fluctuate, the options to buy a good and safe property is less. On a contrary, countries like United Arab Emirates, which is also known as a tax-friendly country, the scope for investing comes with a wide scope and benefits to the investors. Similarly, there are many such laws that favour the investors to help them cut the extra expenses and save a fortune!

Every country is designed with protocols that can be favourable or otherwise to the investors. With accurate research and understanding of markets, a buyer/investor can choose the right market that suits his/her needs that also helps them bring the best return on their investments.

Placing your eggs in one basket is the most outdated investment strategy for anyone who never settles! Thus, here are a few reasons as to why investing overseas/ International is the best thing to consider in 2020.

## Benefits of currency exchange rates 
As the exchange rate of other countries varies drastically to that of Indian, the profit also varies depending on the place we invest. For instance, investing in UAE or European countries can offer us double returns on our investment when calculated in Indian currency. This way, the investor is more likely to be a millionaire overnight! Isn’t that a cool thing to consider now?

## Split and diversify in varied economies
By now, the returns are always higher than the native country’s ROI. Another chance of earning a bounty is by considering investment in various places instead of relying on one. In this case even if things go south with your currency, you will still be able to have a positive portfolio. In other words, the risk of investment is split economically that provides lesser risk.

## Hefty growth rates
In simple words, few countries will generally have investment benefits which other countries may not have. Since the corporate revenue directly influences the economic conditions of a country, it is more likely beneficial to invest in countries that are emerging and slowly dominating the larger markets as they have a great future value and appreciations to rely upon. A stable growth rate will not fetch much as the demand is generally stagnant until something big impacts the economy of such countries.

## Broader scope
Broader market exposure is yet another reason why global market is a lot more beneficial than native lands. International investments are best when the future predictions are in favour of what you desire. Thus, it is highly recommended to have a thorough check of the markets you are interested to pitch in.

## Majority of Realty market relies outside India
As mentioned above, growth rates imply on ROI which can be expected from emerging markets of the world. Focusing only on local area can fetch minimal amount of profit whereas the realty markets of other places like Germany, France, Dubai, China are in demand for realty units.
 

Conclusion:
If you are a complete newbie to foreign investments, then it is highly recommended to have a check on foreign investments and their average ROI.
