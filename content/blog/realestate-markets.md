# Underrated Real Estate Markets

A new report from Realtor.com identified the housing markets that are expected to see the most notable home sales and price growth in 2020. Boise ranked No. 1, a marked increase from No. 8 a year ago.

Driving Boise’s climb up the Realtor.com ranking is the massive influx of new residents from pricier parts of the country — in particular, California. Many of these out-of-state buyers are drawn by the city’s mild climate, the outdoor lifestyle, strong schools and its major employers, including HP HPQ, -1.22%  and Micron Technologies MU, +1.97%.

The risk of a housing bubble is highest across the Eurozone and Canada while lessening across U.S. cities, according to a report from UBS.

The German city was followed by Toronto, Hong Kong and Amsterdam. Frankfurt, Vancouver and Paris are in bubble risk territory, too, with low-interest rates considered the main driver in European cities, in particular, the investment bank said.
