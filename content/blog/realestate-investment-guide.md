- Take a stab at marking leases with yearly accelerations of 5% rather than 15% like clockwork so, inhabitants discover the expansion slower.
- Investors should hope to buy resources beneath substitution (cost of purchasing area and building the property from the beginning). This will imply that rents cannot go down a lot of lower as new forms will take greater expenses to be created.

- Buy just finished rent resources so that renting and advancement hazards are completely alleviated. The exact opposite thing you need to do in these circumstances is to search for another occupant or be managing a rogue engineer.
- Search for Grade A global occupants for whom rental expenses are a little extent of all-out incomes that do not look at these assets as cost centres.
