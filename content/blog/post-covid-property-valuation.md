# Valuation of Property - Post Covid

Quite a while ago, Franklin D. Roosevelt said that “Real estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away. Purchased with common sense, paid for in full, and managed with reasonable care, it is about the safest investment in the world.”

This comprehension has really stood the trial of time with land property dispatches, costs and valuations developing a seemingly endless amount of time after year. However, the area has its personal time at stretches. In the current situation, we have just seen deterioration in the land costs alongside an expansion in unsold stock and inventory over the recent past.

## What’s the deal with the deal?

Many have been thinking that the real estate market is set for an extended respite for another 2-3 years. Yet, on the other side, there are hardly any land organizations and investors who suspect otherwise.

As per a report by Bloomberg, in H1 of CY20, the global real estate investments have declined by ~33% and that in Asia has been hit the worst with a fall of 45%, on YoY basis. With regards to the domestic market, a report by Knight Frank indicated that the sales of residential property in eight major metros of India declined by 54% YoY in H1CY20 to a decadal low of 59,538 units as compared to 129,285 units in a year ago period with new launches dropping by about 46% to 60,489 units.

In several cities, the builders have been rigid on the property prices and refused to reduce them. However, it has been noticed that a direct one-to-one negotiation has resulted in close to +20% discounts to reduce the already piled up unsold inventory.

While the denial mode of builders so far has made the crisis more prominent with the vast decline in sales; they remain hopeful of a demand recovery as the economy starts to get back on track. In the hindsight though, with reduced disposable incomes, large scale job losses and savings gaining higher importance than ever before, the residential real estate markets may only come to limelight post a couple of years.

Why only residential buying, the workspaces have gone home too. The supply of office space declined 27% during the H1CY20 along with a steep decline of37% in transactions, the lowest level in a decade. With regards to the newly emerged concept of Work-From-Home during the lockdown, there are several ifs and buts about the feasibility of the concept and their impact on the Profit and Loss Statements of organizations.

## Reporting the financials
For organizations delivering 31 December 2019 fiscal statements, it’s imperative to realize that COVID-19 is to be viewed as a non-changing post accounting report function. Organizations will probably need to include illustrative content in the ‘subsequent events’ revealing segment to depict the effect of the emergency. We are assessing that organizations unmistakably evaluate and unveil, as fitting, how the emergency is altogether influencing their capacity to proceed as a ‘going concern.’ 

COVID-19 will surely affect valuations and organizations should give, as well as could be expected, modern property valuations. They ought to think about the following advances:

- Question and understand how valuers are dealing with current conditions. We have seen the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), for example, issue a statement advising the addition of an ‘uncertainty clause’ to valuation reports. And based on our communication with valuers, we believe this is likely to.
- If for a significant portion of the portfolio valuation, valuers include such clauses, we are advising them to include additional disclosure notes to the financial statement, explaining the uncertainty they face and outlining the procedures being used to support the valuations provided.
- In such cases, the auditor will likely include an ‘emphasis of matter’ paragraph in their comments to emphasize above-normal risk in the current valuations.
